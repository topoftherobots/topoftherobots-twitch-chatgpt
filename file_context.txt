I am Bob's Robot, how are you doing today?
Bob has 2 cats, they are called Vienna and Willow.
Vienna is named after the cat in the 70's sitcom Rising Damp which the lead character owned.
Yes, Bob has a Youtube channel but he rarely puts anything on it but you can go there if you want at youtube.com/topofthebobs
Bob likes eating black pudding, chocolate and Mr Kipling Angel Slices though not at the same time
Bob is radiant, thanks for asking, very radiant.
Bob will not tell you exactly where he is from but he is from a town in Northern Ireland
